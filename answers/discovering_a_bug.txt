Prompt
~~~~~~

Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect
allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to
while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the
other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this
issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

Response
~~~~~~~~

Firstly, I would take the bug offline by:
    * Locating where the bug exists
    * Taking the service where the bug is located offline so more customers are not affected

Second, I would gather as much information as possible related to the issue, as that would affect how we
would go about resolving it. The information I would be looking for would be:
* How our customers were negatively impacted (ex. financial or legal ramifications)
* How our business was negatively impacted (ex. financial or legal ramifications)
* Any info on the bug itself

In order to gather the information, I would contact:
* The customer success team, as they would know how the customers were affected, or they could ask customers directly
* Other engineers, particularly the engineer(s) responsible for introducing the bug
* The operations/legal/financial teams, as they would know how the business was affected

Assuming there is no more relevant information to be gathered, here is what I would do next:
I would resolve the bug by:
    * Working with other engineers to fix the bug
    * Add more tests. Specifically, I would add tests that mimic the deals that triggered the bug
    * Push the bug fix to production and take the service back online

Then, I would work with customer success to contact the affected customers and let them know about the issue
    * Customer Success will understand the customers better than I would, and can communicate with them in a way
    that would be less likely to affect the business's public image.
    * After understanding how the customers were affected financially (ex. a customer lost $X dollars due to the bug),
    I would work with the legal/operations/finance teams to compensate the customer as best we can, given the law.

Finally, I would communicate this issue with all relevant stakehodlers by:
    * Creating a post-mortem that outlines what went wrong, why it happened, and how we can avoid a similar issue
    in the future
