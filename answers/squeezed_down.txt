An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

I would work with the Account Manager responsible for that unhappy investor and try to understand them better.
Sometimes people are upset for something completely different than what they say they are upset about.
For example, perhaps this investor has had a history of not understanding the product and how to use it, or they are
a legacy customer that has not been informed about new features. Or maybe this investor is only looking at certain deals,
in which case we could inform them of other deals that they were not aware of.

Next, I would work with the Account Manager to inform them about how the system works, and that they can't reach
their requested amount simply because of supply and demand. Obviously, they may still be upset. To remedy this,
I would see if there is anything else we could offer them to make them less upset. Ex. upgrading their memebership to a
higher tier for free, giving them early access to exclusive deals in the future (if this is legally possible), etc.

Currently, the proration logic only considers that they investor has historically invested, but does NOT include what
they have ATTEMPTED to invest in the past. Our proation logic currently uses average historical investments as a way to
assign priority. Instead, we could also add historical REQUESTED investment size to the proration calculation.
This way, we could give additional priority to investors who have attempted to invest large sums.

This might look like:
allocation_factor_denominator = sum of average allocation across all investors + 0.5 * (sum of average attempted allocation across all investors)
allocation_factor_numerator = average_allocation + 0.5 * average_requested_allocation
allocation_factor = allocation_factor_numerator / allocation_factor_denominator
Investor allocation = available_allocation * allocation_factor

Available allocation: $100
Investor A requested to invest $150
Investor B requested to invest $50

Investor A has a historical average investment size of $100, but has attempted to invest $500 in the past on average
Investor B has a historical average investment size of $25, but has attempted to invest $500 in the past on average

After proration:
allocation_factor_denominator = (100 + 25) + 0.5 * (500+500) = 625

investor_a_allocation_factor_numerator = 100 + 0.5 * 500 = 350
investor_a_allocation_factor = 350 / 625 = 0.56
investor_a_allocation = 100 * 0.56 = $56

investor_b_allocation_factor_numerator = 25 + 0.5 * 500 = 275
investor_b_allocation_factor = 275 / 625 = 0.44
investor_b_allocation = 100 * 0.44 = $44

With our current algorithm,
Investor A would invest $80
Investror B would invest $20

With the new algorithm,
Investor A would invest $56
Investor B would invest $44

This allows Investor B to invest more than they would have been able to otherwise, since we are rewarding them
for their historically high attempted investments.
